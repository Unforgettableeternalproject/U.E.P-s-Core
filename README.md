"So the time finally came, and you got the chance to achieve your dream, that's pretty neat."

"Yeah, I am really excited about this project, who knows what I'll eventually become?"
"Probably become more annoying than usual, I hope that will not happen."

"Perhaps you'll be able to be like me as well?"
"Not in the next decade."
