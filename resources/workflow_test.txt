Wait, so you are the maid of the Administrator, who is hostile to all the foreigners but is here to help us?"

"If possible, please reduce the surprised look and lower your voice. The eyes of the Governer are everywhere."

The maid took off her mask and was going to take her clothes off too. However, the later action was aborted by Novia.

Everyone was shocked by her sudden behavior, but the maid herself did not understand the shock.

"What were you trying to do just then?!"
"I thought people should be naked when asking for help sincerely. Was I wrong?"

"What's wrong with your morality?! Is this one of your cultures?"
"I apologize for my inappropriate wrongdoings. Should I put my mask back on too?"

Miller put his hand on his hair and did not have a word to say.
Area 9 is strange enough, and now this.

Xavier approached the maid and asked for the name.

Yvonne, or Yvonne Sehor as a whole.

"Miss Sehor, am I right? You do realize that we just met two hours ago, right? How are we getting your trust so quickly?"
"Just call me Yvonne. It's faster."

"Right, okay, Yvonne. What is your purpose for helping us?"
"Please become our new savior and save us from this hell."
