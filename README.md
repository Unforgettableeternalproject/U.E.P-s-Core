# U.E.P's Core

"Hello! My name is U.E.P, but you can call me U as well~"
"So the time finally came, and you got the chance to achieve your dream, that's pretty neat."

"Yeah, I am really excited about this project, who knows what I'll eventually become?"
"Probably become more annoying than usual, I hope that will not happen."

"Perhaps you'll be able to be like me as well?"
"Not in the next decade."

✯ Visions:
-
  𖥔 An AI desktop pet that will mess up your computer
  
  𖥔 Can communicate with you, have a custom voice model
  
  𖥔 She knows who you are, she knows what you want
  
  𖥔 And stories!

⚑ To-do List:
-
  ✧ (Stage 0.5) Illustrate concept arts, make a back-end terminal window for future debugging -> (Working on it)
  
  ✧ (Stage 1) Make Speech Recognition, Semantic Analysis, Speaker Identification 
  
  ✧ (Stage 1.5) Create a midway controller to communicate with a RWKV model
  
  ✧ (Stage 2) Create a role-play-oriented RWKV model, and embed a database to store memories
  
  ✧ (Stage 2.5) Enrich the pre-trained model with outer knowledge so that it can answer more aspects of questions
  
  ✧ (Stage 3) Add text to speech, and make the model response using their **OWN** voice (which requires a custom voice model)
  
  ✧ (Stage 3.5 ~ 6) Still a secret for now :)

♠︎ To-Be-Fixed/Added:
-
  ✂ RWKV model not responding
  
  ✂ Integrate a winform application for the terminal

  ✂ Establish a connection to PicoVoice's API (For the speaker identification)
  
Preserved for future check: git 3 steps
1. ```git add .```
2. ```git git commit -m "commit message"```
3. ```git push```
