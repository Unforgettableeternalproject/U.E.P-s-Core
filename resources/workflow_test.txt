Dalvis:
The world has gotten different.
You and I are no longer the same.
But we are destined to meet at this moment.
At least the stars still shine like precious gems.

Can you listen to me, my unnecessary rival?
Xavier and Dalvis, just like before.
How did our partnership decay, what are you looking for?
Now is the chance that you tell me all.

Xavier:
I have seen fantasy, I have seen dreams.
None of them are being achieved.
Crying out sorrow, for no reason at all.
Is this what you're looking for?

We were young and immature.
Did not know what the consequences were.
Just give up your refusal to accept.
There's a possibility for us to reunite.
