For some reason, the sand here in Area 9 is almost uncomfortable.
It's not because of its temperature or something like that, but the texture.

Typically, sand would be granular and solid when stacked together and is soft and enveloping.

This desert is abnormally weird. The ground feels like shallow plastic and can sometimes exudate unknown liquids.

"Where are we heading now?"

The first to speak is Naya, still curious as usual.
Yvonne did not care to answer at first but did it anyways.

"The tunnel deep under, or could you say the underpass."
"Underground? But why?"

"As you have all been to the village, the eyes of the Governer should be on you now. We have to hide and wait until the crescent."

"Ok, Miss Sehor, I know you have a lot to tell, but most of us have only got to this place for the first time. Can you please elaborate more about those metaphors you just used?" 

The candle on Yvonne's hand is slowly burning out.

"Where should I begin, Mr.Ark."
"I am not exactly sure why you would call me that, but here's my problem: What are the eyes? And why should we hide? Finally, why wait for the crescent? Does it mean we'll have to stay here for half a month?"

As Xavier had remembered, this seemed to be the first time someone called Raxical by his last name.
